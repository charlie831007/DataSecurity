Wolak\\n\\nRegulators of electricity markets around the world continue to struggle\\nwith the problem of incentivizing generators whose output, due to their\\nlocation in the grid, has no viable substitutes.  Such generators possess\\n\\'local\\' market power.  Since these generators also compete in broader\\nregional markets, the actions taken to exploit their local market power can\\nalso effect market outcomes over larger areas.

These consumers remain, by default,\\ncustomers of the utility distribution companies (UDCs). Pricing electricity\\nfor these default customers is now an issue before the California Public\\nUtilities Commission. In California this issue is framed largely in terms\\nof two alternatives: pass through of the wholesale electricity price or a\\nperformance-based rate (PBR). Under the first alternative, purchase from\\nthe California Power Exchange (PX) would be mandatory; under the second,\\neach UDC would determine where to purchase supply and each UDC\\'s\\nperformance would be gauged by comparing its costs to the PX price. This\\npaper identifies issues that should be addressed in choosing between the\\ntwo alternatives. First the paper examines the effects of the two\\nalternatives on electricity prices. The analysis suggests that, at least in\\nthe near term, the choice will not have much effect on prices. Next the\\npaper looks at possible perverse incentives. A central concern here is\\nthat, if providing default service becomes profitable, UDCs might use their\\ndistribution assets to stifle competition in the retail market.
